# Jake DAY1 experiments

Updated: 2026-09-15T03:12:56+00:00. Start with a run below; memories and detailed latency are Markdown.

| Full benchmark | State | Latest segment | Snapshots | QA rows |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Gemini — first ten questions](results/gemini/README.md) | Complete: 40 verified QA predictions | 144 | 10 | 40 |
| [Qwen3.5 4B thinking + identity prompt — first ten questions](results/qwen_thinking/README.md) | Running | 125 | 7 | 0 |

[Smoke tests: first-clip comparisons, preflights and short Qwen checks](smoke_tests/README.md). These are separate from the full 10-question runs.

Original videos remain outside this result folder; small QA reference files are under provenance/reference_data. No model weights or remote experiment paths were moved. The remote process continues using its existing checkpoint locations. Different Qwen configurations stay separate; they are not merged into one result. Existing cold-start preflight measurements stay labeled separately from warm-query evaluations.

## Refresh

```bash
python3 scripts/sync_run.py gemini
```

Run that command from this folder, or use its absolute path. The Gemini transfer watcher also updates this layout. Caches are reusable only when provider/model, audio, sampling and schema match; never reuse graph-assigned IDs across different memory constructions.
