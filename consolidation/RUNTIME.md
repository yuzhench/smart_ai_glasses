# Live construction and consolidation

The runtime is an opt-in wrapper around the existing M3 writer and consolidation
logic. It adds no identity namespace: native `character_mappings`, metadata,
observation assignments, and reference assignments remain authoritative. Full internal
evidence is retained while [compact incremental packets](INCREMENTAL.md) scope each
model call and its decisions. `native.project` receives the complete resulting state.

## Construction and snapshots

`ConsolidationRuntime` attaches to the live `VideoGraph`. The existing
`process_segment` entry point opens a writer segment when a runtime is attached;
the stream scheduler must supply the exact media end time as `sample['segment_end_s']`.
Other construction entry points use `with runtime.segment(clip_id, end_seconds)`.
There must be one ordered clip writer. Normal voice, face, episodic, semantic,
temporal, and embedding construction continues inside that call.

No runtime lock is held across clip processing or model calls. Individual graph
mutations and snapshot copies use a lock. Identity commits occur between clips,
so canonicalization cannot change halfway through a precomputed embedding batch.
Snapshot copying and in-memory commit work scale with graph size; this is not a
zero-latency or hard real-time guarantee. There is no network, model inference,
or file publication inside the live commit.

At a completed clip boundary, the default 1,200-second scheduler deep-copies the
native graph and records its construction revision, clip cutoff, and timestamp.
Nodes, edges, identity state, and embedding inputs in that snapshot cannot acquire
later observations. A worker that mutates its input snapshot is rejected.
One active and one waiting snapshot are retained. The waiting snapshot receives
preceding accepted identity changes with the live commit's character-ID remapping;
its raw nodes, observations, and cutoff stay frozen.

## Worker, patch, and commit

`runtime_io.NativeConsolidationWorker` takes two adapters: the existing evidence
collector and the configured proposal callable. It passes frozen-prefix evidence
through the existing evidence builder, proposal call, executor, and native
application stage. It saves the snapshot, evidence, patch, execution report, and
identity report, `prompt_packet.json`, `prompt_scope.json`, and `prompt_size.json`;
proposal callables retain exact prompt/response files. The worker establishes scope
even when the proposal callback supplies recorded decisions.

The worker runs a configured `WindowMoss` stage before preparing evidence and calling
the reasoner. Audio starts at the frozen graph's previous successful identity cutoff
and ends at the snapshot cutoff. It never reprocesses an earlier prefix for a later
window. Imported evidence must match both endpoints and use session-time timestamps.
MOSS failure or a mismatched interval prevents reasoning and leaves the window retryable.
Completed HTTP MOSS results are reused on retry only if the window, audio hash, model,
and revision match.

For automatic audio preparation, the evidence collector supplies `replay.segments`
with `absolute_start_seconds`, `absolute_end_seconds`, `source`, and
`start_seconds_in_source`, plus `replay.origin_seconds`. The renderer selects only the
window's audio and preserves gaps as silence. Speaker labels remain scoped to each run.

The returned patch contains the original snapshot and the staged native identity
result. Source-node or edge edits, cutoff violations, and mismatched identity bases
are rejected. The commit reconciles identity state against current native state;
it never replaces live nodes, embeddings, edges, or temporal indices with the old
snapshot. Concurrently allocated character IDs are retained and worker-local new
IDs are remapped monotonically when necessary.

Hot features assigned by construction to a subsequently merged character inherit
the surviving native character. Appending observations to a reviewed raw feature
invalidates global completeness; the existing strict >75% provisional admission
rule applies to those new observations. Mixed, unscoped features remain unresolved.

## Retrieval and background indexing

The live graph contains both hot and consolidated memory. Existing native retrieval
accepts that graph and captures a request-local read snapshot, including hot text
nodes. It ranks both regions using the same `search_text_nodes` path.

The commit records `current_graph_version`, `entity_registry_version`,
`last_consolidated_clip_id`, and `last_consolidated_timestamp`. Changed retrieval
representations receive `embedding_stale=True`. The worker uses the existing
canonicalizer and selective native reindexer; construction and retrieval do not
trigger synchronous catch-up embedding. During reindexing, old vectors remain
searchable, so ranking temporarily reflects their previous identity text.

Embedding results install only when the live identity revision, raw contents, and
effective canonical text still match. A superseded result is discarded and a new
pass is scheduled. No native audio, face, or image vectors are changed.

For automatic native publication, supply `runtime_io.RetrievalPublisher`. It advances
a separate retrieval checkpoint pointer only after a successful staged publish. Use a
dedicated runtime publication directory. This checkpoint is never loaded over the
growing live graph. Native M3 retrieval serves hot memory immediately; a persisted
checkpoint contains only the memory present in its indexed snapshot, not later hot
arrivals.

## Wiring

```python
from functools import partial
from consolidation.runtime import ConsolidationRuntime
from consolidation.runtime_io import NativeConsolidationWorker, RetrievalPublisher
from consolidation.llm_consolidator import propose_official
from consolidation.moss_runner import WindowMoss

# collect_evidence(snapshot) returns {replay, moss, assignments} using only the
# frozen prefix and its saved observation/audio evidence. Replay cutoff must match.
worker = NativeConsolidationWorker(
    collect_evidence,
    partial(propose_official, api_config=api_config_path),
    directory=run_directory / 'jobs',
    moss=WindowMoss(moss_endpoint, media_root, revision=moss_revision),
)
runtime = ConsolidationRuntime(
    video_graph, worker,
    publish_index=RetrievalPublisher(run_directory / 'retrieval'),
)
# Existing process_segment calls now participate automatically when given
# sample['segment_end_s']. Legacy/custom clip writers use runtime.segment(...).
# On stream shutdown, after the final clip:
runtime.close()
```

No default API call is silently enabled. The deployment explicitly supplies its
existing evidence collector and configured proposal callable; tests use saved or
deterministic decisions. Runtime objects/locks/executors are excluded from pickles.
Native identity and watermarks persist; attach a new runtime after loading a checkpoint.
Instead of passing `WindowMoss`, set `MOSS_ENDPOINT`, `MOSS_MEDIA_ROOT`, and optional
`MOSS_REVISION`, or return exact-window `moss` from the evidence collector. With none
of these, the worker raises a configuration error before reasoning. Explicit
`moss=False` permits recorded/no-MOSS test or ablation runs.

## Scheduling and failures

One sequential reasoning worker processes every 1,200-second boundary, aligned to
completed clips. Windows do not coalesce. When one job is active (or retained for
retry) and another snapshot is waiting, the writer pauses before the next
boundary-crossing clip. The condition wait releases the lock so workers and readers
can proceed. This deliberately applies backpressure if reasoning cannot keep up.

Model, budget, or patch validation failure leaves identity and watermark unchanged.
`runtime.errors` records failures; `runtime.retry()` retries the original frozen
window before the waiting window can run. There is no automatic model retry loop.
Index failures retain old vectors and publication; retry explicitly or at the next
completed clip. `close()` drains queued jobs and consolidates a remaining final tail
exactly once. A retained failure raises a retry-required error and leaves the runtime
attached for recovery. Finish the active clip before calling `close()`.

The queue is process-local and is not serialized into graph pickles. Recovery after
process loss must restore/replay from an appropriate completed checkpoint; queued
jobs are not a durable work queue.

Deterministic tests cover clips 40–45 created/retrieved during a blocked clip-39
job, hot identity inheritance, immutable snapshots, cutoff rejection, atomic
failure/retry, selective/background reindexing, suffix completeness invalidation,
ordered windows, backpressure, queued identity rebasing, final draining,
writer-boundary commits, native application reuse, and publication rollback.
